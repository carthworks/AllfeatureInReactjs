a React.js version. We'll cover various aspects such as component creation, routing, state management, and use of hooks to ensure a comprehensive assessment of React.js skills.

Task Requirements:
#Component Creation:
Create a component named UserList that fetches a list of users from a mock API service (UserService) during the component's lifecycle.
Display the list of users in a table format using Bootstrap or any CSS framework of your choice.
#Routing:
Implement routing for the application with at least two routes:
/users: Display the UserList component.
/user/:id: Display detailed information of a specific user when the user clicks on a user in the UserList.
#State Management:
Use React's state management (useState or useReducer) to manage the list of users fetched from the API.

##Custom Components and Hooks:
Create a custom hook (useHighlight) that highlights the background color of a table row when the user hovers over it.
Apply this custom hook to highlight rows in the UserList component.

#Lifecycle Methods and Hooks:
Utilize lifecycle methods or hooks (useEffect) to fetch user data from UserService when the UserList component mounts.


Additional Guidelines:
Use functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) where appropriate.
Use React Router for navigation and ensure proper route configuration.
Style the application using Bootstrap or another CSS framework for responsive design.
Ensure code cleanliness and readability with appropriate comments and structure.
Handle edge cases such as error handling during data fetching and navigation to non-existent user IDs.
